title: CUMCM
---

The **CUMCM** (Chinese Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling) is a competition where participants do not directly enter the national finals.

Instead, they must go through a selection process involving the **University-level competition** (校赛), **Provincial-level competition** (省赛), and only after that will their papers be submitted for evaluation by national experts. Thus, the competition is informally divided into three stages: **University-level competition**, **Provincial-level competition**, and **National-level competition**.

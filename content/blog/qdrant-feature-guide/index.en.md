A detailed overview of Qdrant vector database's core functionalities to help developers design better database solutions in practice. ðŸ˜‹
{{< /lead >}}

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on vector databases is widely used in production. A vector database primarily stores vectors, enabling precise **similarity-based queries** through vector operations, a foundational capability in various applications.

Among many vector database providers such as Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, and Chroma, we will focus exclusively on Qdrant, referencing the official [Qdrant documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/) (2025-03).

## Basic Data Types

Qdrant defines specific data abstractions to handle vector data effectively:

### Point

The fundamental unit of storage in a vector database. Typically, a point contains a vector and an optional payload with additional metadata:

**Point = Vector + Payload**

```json
{
    "id": 129,
    "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
    "payload": {"color": "red"}
}
```

Qdrant supports several vector types:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Dense vectors|Standard vectors generated by most embedding models.|
|Sparse vectors|Variable-length vectors with few non-zero elements; useful for token matching and collaborative filtering.|
|Multi vectors|Matrices composed of multiple dense vectors; each point may have different vector counts but identical dimensions.|
|Named vectors|A mix of the above types, allowing various vector types within a single point.|

### Payload

Additional metadata stored with vectors using JSON syntax:

```json
{
    "name": "jacket",
    "colors": ["red", "blue"],
    "count": 10,
    "price": 11.99,
    "locations": [{"lon": 52.5200, "lat": 13.4050}],
    "reviews": [
        {"user": "alice", "score": 4},
        {"user": "bob", "score": 5}
    ]
}
```

Payloads enhance semantic similarity searches by enabling additional **logical filtering conditions**.

### Collection

A group of points. Collections allow you to define:

1. Similarity algorithms between points
2. Vector dimensions
3. Optimizer settings
4. HNSW algorithm parameters
5. Write-Ahead Log (WAL) configurations
6. Quantization settings

## Common Operations

The essential operations for using vector databases:

### Search

Primarily refers to **similarity search**, leveraging the concept that objects with higher similarity are closer in vector space. Qdrant supports various similarity algorithms:

- Dot product
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Manhattan distance

Vectors are normalized when stored, making dot product and cosine similarity equivalent in Qdrant.

Qdrant provides a comprehensive [Search API](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/search/#search-api), enabling:

1. Basic searches with a vector or specifying a named vector.
2. Control over search algorithms, including exact matching (slower but precise).
3. Result filtering based on payload tags or similarity thresholds.
4. Limiting search results (`limit`).
5. Batch searches for multiple vectors.
6. Grouping search results (`group_size`).
7. Query planning for optimized performance based on heuristic evaluations.

When using both `group_size` and `limit`, the `limit` parameter indicates the number of groups.

Sparse vectors and dense vectors differ notably in search behavior:

| Aspect            | Sparse Vectors                                | Dense Vectors                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Similarity method | Defaults to dot product, no need to specify   | You can specify supported algorithms |
| Search approach   | Only exact search                             | HNSW for approximate searching       |
| Search results    | Only vectors sharing common non-zero elements | Top `limit` vectors as specified     |

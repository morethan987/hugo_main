## Introduction



## Model Training



## Model Deployment



## Application Development

This section mainly documents the practical experiences of large models oriented towards application development based on foundational models.

### Some Reflections

When we have become accustomed to casually opening an AI chat assistant: DouBao, Kimi, DeepSeek... something that appears so simple, it might seem like creating one ourselves wouldn't be too difficult, right?

This was my "dream starting point"ðŸ˜¢ It sounds ridiculous, but I really thought that at the time. And then came the long journey of development.

If you have similar thoughts, the content below may be helpful to youðŸ¤—

After staying up so many nights, I must admit that "building an LLM application" is a very extensive topic, especially for an independent developer. If you choose to do independent development or form a small team, it also means you've chosen a tough path: there's no "senior" to help you explore the technical route; everything has to be figured out by yourself.

**However**, this is where the fun of independent development lies: you can fully control the direction of your product and watch it gradually iterate and improve.

You might ask: "What if the product doesn't perform well?"; "What if the development gets stuck?"; "If no one uses it, isn't my time wasted?"ðŸ¤”

It must be said that the investment in independent development is truly substantial, and these questions are unavoidable, even inevitable for most independent developers.

But if you really take "independent development" seriously, regardless of the outcome, I believe you will gain something: if you succeed, congratulations to you hereðŸ¥³ Your hard work has paid off; if you fail or give up, I understand your frustration and even anger.

But no one can find happiness or success in completely negating their past. Forget those pains for now and move on to the next step in life.

There are no wrong turns in life; every step countsðŸ«¡
